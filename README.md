# Girl Safety Online
Internet is such a bad place to openly share all your personals. Girls need to be extra vigilant. No one can be trusted with your privacy. Neither your father, brother, friend, boyfriend, lover, ex, or even husband. All men are dogs. Take your privacy in your hands.
This is a series of my articles deadling with various aspects of exposing your privacy unintentionally and how to protect yourself from it.
## Some tips for Online Privacy
1. ***Always clear your browser history, esp. any cache and cookies***
2. Your social media apps or messenger apps can be decieving with their looks. Don't trust their cute faces.
3. Like: the deleted messages from whatsapp are actually not deleted, they are still hiding behind the app's UI in your backups. Always delete the backups.
4. If you have a doubt your apps are hacked, uninstall, delete backups (both local and cloud), install again.
5. There is nothing to lose in history when your present is at stake.
6. Be extra vigilant.
